# XPath XML Model

This project contains an XPath parser and creates an [XML model](src/main/resources/rnc/xpath-model.rnc) from it. The model can be used to make deeper analyzis, convert or serialize the expression to a normalizes XPath expression.

An XPath normalizer could:

* normalize ignoreable whitespace
* remove/normalize ignoreable brackets
* indention of the expressions


An analyzer could make statements abould:

* used/unused functions or variables
* validation of XPath version (I want to use XPath 2.0 only features though my processor supports 3.0)
* used location steps (comparing to a given schema?)

A converter could manipulate given XPath expressions:

* wrap all location steps by a function call
* wrap all sub expressions by a function call
* ...?

This project is based on the work of others. It uses:

* An XSLT parser for XPath generated by the [REx Parser Generator](https://www.bottlecaps.de/rex/) 
* An [XSLT based implementation of Relax NG](https://github.com/maxtoroq/rng.xsl) by [@maxtoroq](https://github.com/maxtoroq)
