# XPath XML Model

This project contains an XPath parser and creates an [XML model](src/main/resources/rnc/xpath-model.rnc) from it.

* [Wiki](https://github.com/nkutsche/xpath-model/wiki)

## Basic Idea

The model can be used to make deeper analyzis, convert or serialize the expression to normalize XPath expressions.

An XPath normalizer could:

* normalize ignoreable whitespace
* remove/normalize ignoreable brackets
* indention of the expressions


An analyzer could make statements abould:

* used/unused functions or variables
* validation of XPath version (I want to use XPath 2.0 only features though my processor supports 3.0)
* used location steps (comparing to a given schema?)

A converter could manipulate given XPath expressions:

* wrap all location steps by a function call
* wrap all sub expressions by a function call
* ...?

## Standard conformance

* The core parser in this project is generated based on the official EBNF file which defines XPath 3.1 using the REx Parser Generator (see [Contribute](#contribute)).
* There is an extra [testing project](https://github.com/nkutsche/xpath-model-qt3) that ensures that all valid expressions in the [QT3 testsuite](https://github.com/w3c/qt3tests) (~15k test cases):
    * are parsed to a valid model
    * can be parsed and re-serialized without any relevant changes.


## Contribute

This project is based on the work of others. It uses:

* An XSLT parser for XPath generated by the [REx Parser Generator](https://www.bottlecaps.de/rex/) 
* An [XSLT based implementation of Relax NG](https://github.com/maxtoroq/rng.xsl) by [@maxtoroq](https://github.com/maxtoroq)
